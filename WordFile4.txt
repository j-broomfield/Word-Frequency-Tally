patience
of
an
oyster
I
wish
I
had
our
Dinah
here
I
know
I
do
said
Alice
aloud
addressing
nobody
in
particular
She
d
soon
fetch
it
back
And
who
is
Dinah
if
I
might
venture
to
ask
the
question
said
the
Lory
Alice
replied
eagerly
for
she
was
always
ready
to
talk
about
her
pet
Dinah
our
cat
And
she
such
a
capital
one
for
catching
mice
you
cannot
think
And
oh
I
wish
you
could
see
her
after
the
birds
Why
she
eat
a
little
bird
as
soon
as
look
at
it
This
speech
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
party
Some
of
the
birds
hurried
off
at
once
one
old
Magpie
began
wrapping
itself
up
very
carefully
remarking
I
really
must
be
getting
home
the
night
air
does
not
suit
my
throat
and
a
Canary
called
out
in
a
trembling
voice
to
its
children
Come
away
my
dears
It
high
time
you
were
all
in
bed
On
various
pretexts
they
all
moved
off
and
Alice
was
soon
left
alone
I
wish
I
had
not
mentioned
Dinah
she
said
to
herself
in
a
melancholy
tone
Nobody
seems
to
like
her
down
here
and
I
m
sure
she
the
best
cat
in
the
world
Oh
my
dear
Dinah
I
wonder
if
I
shall
ever
see
you
any
more
And
here
poor
Alice
began
to
cry
again
for
she
felt
very
lonely
and
low
spirited
In
a
little
while
however
she
again
heard
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
distance
and
she
looked
up
eagerly
half
hoping
that
the
Mouse
had
changed
his
mind
and
was
coming
back
to
finish
his
story
CHAPTER
IV
The
Rabbit
Sends
in
a
Little
Bill
It
was
the
White
Rabbit
trotting
slowly
back
again
and
looking
anxiously
about
as
it
went
as
if
it
had
lost
something
and
she
heard
it
muttering
to
itself
The
Duchess
The
Duchess
Oh
my
dear
paws
Oh
my
fur
and
whiskers
She
get
me
executed
as
sure
as
ferrets
are
ferrets
Where
CAN
I
have
dropped
them
I
wonder
Alice
guessed
in
a
moment
that
it
was
looking
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
and
she
very
good
naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
them
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
everything
seemed
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
pool
and
the
great
hall
with
the
glass
table
and
the
little
door
had
vanished
completely
Very
soon
the
Rabbit
noticed
Alice
as
she
went
hunting
about
and
called
out
to
her
in
an
angry
tone
Why
Mary
Ann
what
ARE
you
doing
out
here
Run
home
this
moment
and
fetch
me
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
fan
Quick
now
And
Alice
was
so
much
frightened
that
she
ran
off
at
once
in
the
direction
it
pointed
to
without
trying
to
explain
the
mistake
it
had
made
He
took
me
for
his
housemaid
she
said
to
herself
as
she
ran
How
surprised
he
be
when
he
finds
out
who
I
am
But
I
d
better
take
him
his
fan
and
gloves
that
is
if
I
can
find
them
As
she
said
this
she
came
upon
a
neat
little
house
on
the
door
of
which
was
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
name
W
RABBIT
engraved
upon
it
She
went
in
without
knocking
and
hurried
upstairs
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann
and
be
turned
out
of
the
house
before
she
had
found
the
fan
and
gloves
How
queer
it
seems
Alice
said
to
herself
to
be
going
messages
for
a
rabbit
I
suppose
Dinah
be
sending
me
on
messages
next
And
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
happen
Miss
Alice
Come
here
directly
and
get
ready
for
your
walk
Coming
in
a
minute
nurse
But
I
got
to
see
that
the
mouse
does
not
get
out
Only
I
don
t
think
Alice
went
on
that
they
d
let
Dinah
stop
in
the
house
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
that
By
this
time
she
had
found
her
way
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
table
in
the
window
and
on
it
as
she
had
hoped
a
fan
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
tiny
white
kid
gloves
she
took
up
the
fan
and
a
pair
of
the
gloves
and
was
just
going
to
leave
the
room
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near
the
looking
glass
There
was
no
label
this
time
with
the
words
DRINK
ME
but
nevertheless
she
uncorked
it
and
put
it
to
her
lips
I
know
SOMETHING
interesting
is
sure
to
happen
she
said
to
herself
whenever
I
eat
or
drink
anything
so
I
just
see
what
this
bottle
does
I
do
hope
it
make
me
grow
large
again
for
really
I
m
quite
tired
of
being
such
a
tiny
little
thing
It
did
so
indeed
and
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected
before
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle
she
found
her
head
pressing
against
the
ceiling
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
broken
She
hastily
put
down
the
bottle
saying
to
herself
That
quite
enough
I
hope
I
shall
not
grow
any
more
As
it
is
I
cannot
get
out
at
the
door
I
do
wish
I
had
not
drunk
quite
so
much
Alas
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that
She
went
on
growing
and
growing
and
very
soon
had
to
kneel
down
on
the
floor
in
another
minute
there
was
not
even
room
for
this
and
she
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
with
one
elbow
against
the
door
and
the
other
arm
curled
round
her
head
Still
she
went
on
growing
and
as
a
last
resource
she
put
one
arm
out
of
the
window
and
one
foot
up
the
chimney
and
said
to
herself
Now
I
can
do
no
more
whatever
happens
What
WILL
become
of
me
Luckily
for
Alice
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
effect
and
she
grew
no
larger
still
it
was
very
uncomfortable
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
sort
of
chance
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
the
room
again
no
wonder
she
felt
unhappy
It
was
much
pleasanter
at
home
thought
poor
Alice
when
one
was
not
always
growing
larger
and
smaller
and
being
ordered
about
by
mice
and
rabbits
I
almost
wish
I
had
not
gone
down
that
rabbit
hole
and
yet
and
yet
it
rather
curious
you
know
this
sort
of
life
I
do
wonder
what
CAN
have
happened
to
me
When
I
used
to
read
fairy
tales
I
fancied
that
kind
of
thing
never
happened
and
now
here
I
am
in
the
middle
of
one
There
ought
to
be
a
book
written
about
me
that
there
ought
And
when
I
grow
up
I
write
one
but
I
m
grown
up
now
she
added
in
a
sorrowful
tone
at
least
there
no
room
to
grow
up
any
more
HERE
But
then
thought
Alice
shall
I
NEVER
get
any
older
than
I
am
now
That
be
a
comfort
one
way
never
to
be
an
old
woman
but
then
always
to
have
lessons
to
learn
Oh
I
should
not
like
THAT
Oh
you
foolish
Alice
she
answered
herself
How
can
you
learn
lessons
in
here
Why
there
hardly
room
for
YOU
and
no
room
at
all
for
any
lesson
books
And
so
she
went
on
taking
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
and
making
quite
a
conversation
of
it
altogether
but
after
a
few
minutes
she
heard
a
voice
outside
and
stopped
to
listen
Mary
Ann
Mary
Ann
said
the
voice
Fetch
me
my
gloves
this
moment
Then
came
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
stairs
Alice
knew
it
was
the
Rabbit
coming
to
look
for
her
and
she
trembled
till
she
shook
the
house
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
Rabbit
and
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
it
Presently
the
Rabbit
came
up
to
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
but
as
the
door
opened
inwards
and
Alice
elbow
was
pressed
hard
against
it
that
attempt
proved
a
failure
Alice
heard
it
say
to
itself
Then
I
will
go
round
and
get
in
at
the
window
THAT
you
won
t
thought
Alice
and
after
waiting
till
she
fancied
she
heard
the
Rabbit
just
under
the
window
she
suddenly
spread
out
her
hand
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
air
She
did
not
get
hold
of
anything
but
she
heard
a
little
shriek
and
a
fall
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass
from
which
she
concluded
that
it
was
just
possible
it
had
fallen
into
a
cucumber
frame
or
something
of
the
sort
Next
came
an
angry
voice
the
Rabbit
Pat
Pat
Where
are
you
And
then
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
before
Sure
then
I
m
here
Digging
for
apples
yer
honour
Digging
for
apples
indeed
said
the
Rabbit
angrily
Here
Come
and
help
me
out
of
THIS
Sounds
of
more
broken
glass
Now
tell
me
Pat
what
that
in
the
window
Sure
it
an
arm
yer
honour
He
pronounced
it
arrum
An
arm
you
goose
Who
ever
saw
one
that
size
Why
it
fills
the
whole
window
Sure
it
does
yer
honour
but
it
an
arm
for
all
that
Well
it
got
no
business
there
at
any
rate
go
and
take
it
away
There
was
a
long
silence
after
this
and
Alice
could
only
hear
whispers
now
and
then
such
as
Sure
I
don
t
like
it
yer
honour
at
all
at
all
Do
as
I
tell
you
you
coward
and
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
again
and
made
another
snatch
in
the
air
This
time
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks
and
more
sounds
of
broken
glass
What
a
number
of
cucumber
frames
there
must
be
thought
Alice
I
wonder
what
they
do
next
As
for
pulling
me
out
of
the
window
I
only
wish
they
COULD
I
m
sure
I
don
t
want
to
stay
in
here
any
longer
She
waited
for
some
time
without
hearing
anything
more
at
last
came
a
rumbling
of
little
cartwheels
and
the
sound
of
a
good
many
voices
all
talking
together
she
made
out
the
words
Where
the
other
ladder
Why
I
had
not
to
bring
but
one
Bill
got
the
other
Bill
fetch
it
here
lad
Here
put
em
up
at
this
corner
No
tie
em
together
first
they
don
t
reach
half
high
enough
yet
Oh
they
ll
do
well
enough
don
t
be
particular
Here
Bill
catch
hold
of
this
rope
Will
the
roof
bear
Mind
that
loose
slate
Oh
it
coming
down
Heads
below
a
loud
crash
Now
who
did
that
It
was
Bill
I
fancy
Who
to
go
down
the
chimney
Nay
I
shall
not
YOU
do
it
That
I
won
t
then
Bill
to
go
down
Here
Bill
the
master
says
you
are
to
go
down
the
chimney
Oh
So
Bill
got
to
come
down
the
chimney
has
he
said
Alice
to
herself
Shy
they
seem
to
put
everything
upon
Bill
I
would
not
be
in
Bill
place
for
a
good
deal
this
fireplace
is
narrow
to
be
sure
but
I
THINK
I
can
kick
a
little
She
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney
as
she
could
and
waited
till
she
heard
a
little
animal
she
could
not
guess
of
what
sort
it
was
scratching
and
scrambling
about
in
the
chimney
close
above
her
then
saying
to
herself
This
is
Bill
she
gave
one
sharp
kick
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
next
The
first
thing
she
heard
was
a
general
chorus
of
There
goes
Bill
then
the
Rabbit
voice
along
Catch
him
you
by
the
hedge
then
silence
and
then
another
confusion
of
voices
Hold
up
his
head
Brandy
now
Don
t
choke
him
How
was
it
old
fellow
What
happened
to
you
Tell
us
all
about
it
Last
came
a
little
feeble
squeaking
voice
That
Bill
thought
Alice
Well
I
hardly
know
No
more
thank
ye
I
m
better
now
but
I
m
a
deal
too
flustered
to
tell
you
all
I
know
is
something
comes
at
me
like
a
Jack
in
the
box
and
up
I
goes
like
a
sky
rocket
So
you
did
old
fellow
said
the
others
We
must
burn
the
house
down
said
the
Rabbit
voice
and
Alice
called
out
as
loud
as
she
could
If
you
do
I
set
Dinah
at
you
There
was
a
dead
silence
instantly
and
Alice
thought
to
herself
I
wonder
what
they
WILL
do
next
If
they
had
any
sense
they
d
take
the
roof
off
After
a
minute
or
two
they
began
moving
about
again
and
Alice
heard
the
Rabbit
say
A
barrowful
will
do
to
begin
with
A
barrowful
of
WHAT
thought
Alice
but
she
had
not
long
to
doubt
for
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
little
pebbles
came
rattling
in
at
the
window
and
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the
face
I
put
a
stop
to
this
she
said
to
herself
and
shouted
out
You
would
better
not
do
that
again
which
produced
another
dead
silence
Alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
pebbles
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
floor
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
head
If
I
eat
one
of
these
cakes
she
thought
it
sure
to
make
SOME
change
in
my
size
and
as
it
cannot
possibly
make
me
larger
it
must
make
me
smaller
I
suppose
So
she
swallowed
one
of
the
cakes
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
began
shrinking
directly
As
soon
as
she
was
small
enough
to
get
through
the
door
she
ran
out
of
the
house
and
found
quite
a
crowd
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
outside
The
poor
little
Lizard
Bill
was
in
the
middle
being
held
up
by
two
guinea
pigs
who
were
giving
it
something
out
of
a
bottle
They
all
made
a
rush
at
Alice
the
moment
she
appeared
but
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
could
and
soon
found
herself
safe
in
a
thick
wood
The
first
thing
I
got
to
do
said
Alice
to
herself
as
she
wandered
about
in
the
wood
is
to
grow
to
my
right
size
again
and
the
second
thing
is
to
find
my
way
into
that
lovely
garden
I
think
that
will
be
the
best
plan
It
sounded
an
excellent
plan
no
doubt
and
very
neatly
and
simply
arranged
the
only
difficulty
was
that
she
had
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
set
about
it
and
while
she
was
peering
about
anxiously
among
the
trees
a
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
in
a
great
hurry
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
down
at
her
with
large
round
eyes
and
feebly
stretching
out
one
paw
trying
to
touch
her
Poor
little
thing
said
Alice
in
a
coaxing
tone
and
she
tried
hard
to
whistle
to
it
but
she
was
terribly
frightened
all
the
time
at
the
thought
that
it
might
be
hungry
in
which
case
it
would
be
very
likely
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
of
all
her
coaxing
Hardly
knowing
what
she
did
she
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
stick
and
held
it
out
to
the
puppy
whereupon
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
once
with
a
yelp
of
delight
and
rushed
at
the
stick
and
made
believe
to
worry
it
then
Alice
dodged
behind
a
great
thistle
to
keep
herself
from
being
run
over
and
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
other
side
the
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
stick
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
its
hurry
to
get
hold
of
it
then
Alice
thinking
it
was
very
like
having
a
game
of
play
with
a
cart
horse
and
expecting
every
moment
to
be
trampled
under
its
feet
ran
round
the
thistle
again
then
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charges
at
the
stick
running
a
very
little
way
forwards
each
time
and
a
long
way
back
and
barking
hoarsely
all
the
while
till
at
last
it
sat
down
a
good
way
off
panting
with
its
tongue
hanging
out
of
its
mouth
and
its
great
eyes
half
shut
This
seemed
to
Alice
a
good
opportunity
for
making
her
escape
so
she
set
off
at
once
and
ran
till
she
was
quite
tired
and
out
of
breath
and
till
the
puppy
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
distance
And
yet
what
a
dear

puppy
it
was
said
